backend development - 
The backend service written in Node.js will interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js to monitor events emitted by the smart contracts. The best approach for sending the rewards would be having two script one which is responsible for the deposit withdrawal of the fun token and storing them into a db and another which would calculate the rewards and mint the win token on the total average of the tokens the store of the private key would be best in a env file as using services like enclave might also pose the same threat as the organizatons server.
